--Interger Array Instructions loop - how many entities are we infinitely looping through?

Java loop to count how many elements are involved in an infinite loop.
Parent loop goes starts at element 0 and steps to the value at that location each time.
Simple call main.
To change interger array input values, go to main, which passes the array to the only method - "answer(numbers)".
